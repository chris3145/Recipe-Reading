Lanzhou Beef Noodle Soup - The Woks of Life
------------------------------------------------

 
4 lbs beef or pork soup bones
2¼ lbs (1 kg) beef shank
½ of a whole roasting chicken (or a leftover roasted chicken carcass)
10 cups water
4 cups (about 1 liter) chicken stock
Spice mix (see recipe below)
Salt, to taste (I added about a tablespoon)
½ of a small Chinese radish, quartered and thinly sliced
1 lb fresh or dried white noodles (they can really be any thickness, as long as they are wheat-based noodles rather than rice noodles, and have a nice chew when cooked)
Hot chili oil, to taste (see recipe below)
chopped scallion
chopped cilantro
7 star anise
12 cloves
1 cinnamon stick
5 bay leaves
6 large slices of sand ginger
1½ teaspoons fennel seeds
1 teaspoon cumin seeds
2 teaspoons Sichuan peppercorns
1½ teaspoons white peppercorns
5 licorice root slices (if you can't find these, you can leave them out)
3 pieces dried orange peel
1 black cardamom
¾ cup oil
2 star anise
½ of a small cinnamon stick
½ teaspoon Sichuan peppercorns
3 tablespoons crushed red pepper flakes (just the regular kind you'd sprinkle on your pizza)
1 teaspoon salt
¼ teaspoon sugar
