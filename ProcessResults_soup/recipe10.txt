Instructions:
Whisk coconut milk, coconut sugar, lime zest, lime juice, fish sauce and ginger in a small bowl. Place skirt steak in a 1 gallon resealable bag. Pour marinade over the steak. Press out air and seal bag shut. Refrigerate the steak 4 to 12 hours.
Preheat grill to high heat.
Drain steak and discard marinade. Pat steaks dry and sprinkle with salt. Oil grill rack and immediately place steaks on the grill. Cook 2 minutes and turn a quarter turn to create hash mark. Continue cooking 30 to 90 seconds more on first side. Flip steaks over and continue cooking 2 Â½ to 5 minutes on the second side to desired doneness, 5 to 8 minutes total depending on thickness of the steaks.
Let steaks rest on carving board at least 4 minutes before cutting lengthwise across the grain.
