Spaghetti Squash Recipe with Mushrooms and Parmesan - Pickled Plum
------------------------------------------------
Ingredients:
1 small spaghetti squash (about 2 pounds)
2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
2 cups button mushrooms, chopped bite size
2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1 tbsp fresh thyme
¼ cup parmesan cheese, grated
1 handful flat leaf parsley, finely chopped
salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 380Fº
In a deep skillet (or large pan), add olive oil, garlic and thyme. Cook for 2 minutes over high heat and add mushrooms. Cook until mushrooms are golden brown (about 7-8 minutes). Turn off the heat and set aside.
Put the spaghetti squash on a baking tray and pierce a the skin a few time using a knife. Bake for about an hour, until squash can be pierced with a knife. Alternatively, you can microwave the spaghetti squash. Instructions are at the bottom.
Take squash out of the oven and let cool to room temperature. Cut in half and get rid of the seeds. Use a fork to scrape the squash into strings.
Add squash to the skillet (or pan), turn the heat to high and quickly fry with mushrooms. Sprinkle parmesan while sauteing for a minute.
Turn the heat off, top with parsley and season with salt and pepper. Serve.
Microwaving spaghetti squash: Place spaghetti squash on a microwave safe plate or other microwave safe container. Place the cut side down (skin facing up). Microwave on high for 10 minutes.
Take the spaghetti squash out of the microwave and shred with a fork. If the squash is still hard, microwave for another 2-3 minutes, or until tender.
