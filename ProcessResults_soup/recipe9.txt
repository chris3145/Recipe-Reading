Baby Broccoli Frittata with Feta | Naturally Ella
------------------------------------------------
Ingredients:
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup thinly sliced red onion
4 to 5 stalks baby broccoli, ends trimmed
6 large eggs
1/3 cup whole milk
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 ounce crumbled feta

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 425Ëš.
Heat an 8" oven-safe skillet over medium, add 1/2 tablespoon olive oil followed by the onions. Cook the onions, stirring often, until tender and beginning to brown, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove and set aside.
Add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon olive oil to the pan. Place the baby broccoli spears into the pan and cook until the green brightens and the ends are browning, turning occasionally, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from pan.
Whisk together the eggs, milk, black pepper, and salt. Pour into the pan and cook for roughly 5 minutes, just long enough for the bottom to set. Lay the cooked baby broccoli on top of the eggs then sprinkle with onions and feta.
Transfer pan to the oven and bake until the frittata has puffed and top is beginning to brown, 15 to 18 minutes.
