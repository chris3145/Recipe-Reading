1 lb. carrots, peeled and sliced into bite-sized rounds (you can to make sure that your carrots and potatoes are chopped small enough so that they become tender by the time the pork is done cooking)

Place pork in the middle of the prepared dish. Arrange vegetables around the pork, and tuck herbs among the vegetables.
Put dish in the oven (uncovered) and roast for 25-35 minutes, or until pork is cooked through (and thermometer reads 150 degrees F).
