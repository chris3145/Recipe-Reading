                </a></p> <p>My new apartment is lovely, but I have a confession. There is zero (and I mean zero), counter space, you guys. This is not unusual if you’re familiar with tiny NYC apartments. It’s not uncommon to have one wall that consists of a stove, sink, and fridge, with the only “counter” surrounding the sink. So cooking has been an interested mix of placing my cutting board on the stove, then moving it when I have to turn the stove on and so forth. I’m working on getting some sort of <a href="http://bit.ly/1lEcwQ1">butcher block</a>, but it takes so much time to decorate! Major life problems over here.</p> <p>Despite the conditions I managed to cook something more than eggs this weekend, and kicked things off with a fritter loaded with caulifower. According to Bethenny Frankel (who was on my plane back from Mexico!), cauliflower is the new kale, so we best get on board. This is totally one of those recipes that feels rich and satisfying but is still packed with veggies. What I might like even more? The shallot yogurt sauce that goes with these babies. Downright addictive.</p> <p>Here’s to a great week!</p> <p><a href="http://clarapersis.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_5073.jpg"></a><a href="http://clarapersis.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_5095.jpg">

Place the cauliflower on a line baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Season the cauliflower with 1 teaspoon of salt and transfer to the oven for 20 minutes, turning once to ensure even roasting.</p> <p>Make the sauce: Coat a small saucepan with olive oil and set to medium low heat. Add in the shallots and sauté until soft and transluscent (6-8 minutes). Place the cooked shallots, yogurt, lemon juice, and salt in a bowl and stir to combine. Set you in fridge to chill while you prepare the fritters.</p> <p>Transfer the cauliflower to a food processor and pulse until the mixture is coarsely ground.</p> <p>Place the cauliflower in a large bowl and add bread crumbs, eggs, flour, yogurt, spices, and 1/4 tsp salt. Mix thoroughly until combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for 3 hours.</p> <p>Scoop 2 tablespoons of the cauliflower mixture into the palm of your hand. Form into a patty 3 inches in diameter and 3/4 inch thick. Continue to make patties with the remaining mixture.</p> <p>Place a skillet over medium high heat, and pour in vegetable oil until it reaches 1/2 inch up the sides. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the fritters, being sure not to overcrowd the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes until golden brown. Gently flip and cook on the opposite side for a minute or two. Transfer to paper towels to drain and then plac then in a preheated 200° oven to keep warm. Repeat the process to cook the remaining fritters.</p>

So cooking has been an interested mix of placing my cutting board on the stove, then moving it when I have to turn the stove on and so forth.

Downright addictive. Here\u2019s to a great week!  Curried Cauliflower Fritters slightly adapted from Pancakes by Adrianna Adarme 1 head cauliflower cut into florets 2 tablespoons olive oil salt 1\/2 cup dry bread crumbs 2 large eggs 2 tabelspoons all purpose flour 2 tablespoons Greek yogurt 1 garlic clove, grated 1 1\/2 tsp curry powder 1 tsp ground cumin 1\/2 tsp tumeric 1\/4 tsp cinnamon handful of cilantro, chopped vegetable oil for frying For the sauce: 1\/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon Greek yogurt 1 shallot, minced 2 tsp lemon juice 1\/4 tsp salt Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Place the cauliflower on a line baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Season the cauliflower with 1 teaspoon of salt and transfer to the oven for 20 minutes, turning once to ensure even roasting. Make the sauce: Coat a small saucepan with olive oil and set to medium low heat. Add in the shallots and saut\u00e9 until soft and transluscent (6-8 minutes). Place the cooked shallots, yogurt, lemon juice, and salt in a bowl and stir to combine. Set you in fridge to chill while you prepare the fritters. Transfer the cauliflower to a food processor and pulse until the mixture is coarsely ground. Place the cauliflower in a large bowl and add bread crumbs, eggs, flour, yogurt, spices, and 1\/4 tsp salt. Mix thoroughly until combined. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator to chill for 3 hours. Scoop 2 tablespoons of the cauliflower mixture into the palm of your hand. Form into a patty 3 inches in diameter and 3\/4 inch thick. Continue to make patties with the remaining mixture. Place a skillet over medium high heat, and pour in vegetable oil until it reaches 1\/2 inch up the sides. Once the oil is hot, carefully add the fritters, being sure not to overcrowd the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes until golden brown. Gently flip and cook on the opposite side for a minute or two. Transfer to paper towels to drain and then plac then in a preheated 200\u00b0 oven to keep warm. Repeat the process to cook the remaining fritters.","content_split":[{"type":"text","value":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\u0022http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/04\/IMG_5086.jpg\u0022\u003E"},{"type":"image","value":"https:\/\/cdn2.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRmNsYXJhcGVyc2lzLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAxNCUyRjA0JTJGSU1HXzUwODYuanBn?checksum=f67d3dcbb1f56b6ef3b01352e72e8213d8d1b6a2\u0026format=s"},{"type":"text","value":"\u003C\/a\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E \u003Cp\u003EMy new apartment is lovely, but I have a confession.

It\u2019s the first time in years that I haven\u2019t felt completely beaten down by it all come March. Granted, the winters of 2014 and 2015 were emotionally bleak times, too, which definitely made the cold temperatures even worse. But either way, it felt so good to be able to revel in the season. Rich dishes. Hot fires. Belly-warming glasses of red wine with good friends. I\u2019m almost sad to see it go! Even though mother nature was easier on us this year, I can\u2019t help but wonder if my happy mood has less to do with the actual weather and more so to do with me. In the last few years I\u2019ve gotten really present to the seasons of my life: seasons of emotional growth, seasons of professional stability, seasons of new beginnings\u2026.the list goes on. In becoming more aware of these seasons, it\u2019s also clarified the control I have over them. Sometimes they\u2019re seasons we\u2019re forced into caused by unanticipated events, but there are also times where we can exercise a sizeable amount of control. Where we can create the actual season of our life. At the beginning of this year, when I sat down to reflect on 2015 and set my intentions for the 12 months to come, there was one word that kept coming up for me. Play. I wanted 2016 to be the year of play, of pleasure, of making having fun my priority. It\u2019s not that previous years weren\u2019t fun. But there was something in me that felt pulled to have play, play (no pun intended) a bigger role in my life this year. That translated into releasing a lot of goals and expectations. I\u2019d work hard this year, but wouldn\u2019t make professional advancement a top priority. I\u2019d eat well and make movement a daily ritual, but not strive so hard for that \u201cperfect figure.\u201d I\u2019d operate from a place of what felt good, versus what I should be doing. In a way, I wanted to drop all the \u201cshoulds\u201d this year. I kind of assumed this shift in mindset would make for a less prolific year on certain fronts. In particular, my career. But the ironic (or perhaps not so ironic) part has been that I\u2019ve actually experienced so much abundance. More opportunity. More exciting opportunity. More work that aligns with my values. I\u2019m in awe of some of the things the world has dropped in my lap in the first two months of the year. The other key thing that\u2019s been guiding how I approach this year is the manifesto we wrote for the podcast. They\u2019re 8 statements that serve as the foundation of our podcast content, and also my life. I like to say they\u2019re affirmations and aspirations all in one; they\u2019re things I strive for on a day-to-day basis, and also things that pretty much guide each and every decision that I make. This means I believe in : Showing up Doing the work Choosing love over fear Striving for simplicity Daring to be vulnerable Asking the big questions Letting my heart do the talking Treating myself like gold In Episode Six of the podcast we break down what each of these eight things mean specifically and how we apply them to our daily lives. The best part is that we actually created a super simple toolkit to incorporate this manifesto into your own life. It\u2019s designed to help you get clear on who and what matters to you. I deeply believe that when you get really clear on what matters in your life, you\u2019ll have a much easier time charting a course for the life you want to live. In fact, I feel like I\u2019m living proof. Even though I\u2019m focused on play, above all, I feel like I\u2019m really living the life I want to live in 2016. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a perfect life. That doesn\u2019t I\u2019m always happy. That doesn\u2019t mean I have all the things I want. It just feels really right for me. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt so good in my own skin. And really, is there anything better? xx Clara \/\/P.S.

After a year of plotting, planning, dreaming, and mostly a ton of hard work, Life Lately, the podcast, is now live! Here\u2019s the backstory if you\u2019d like to hear\u2026 If you\u2019re a Clara Persis\/Channeling Contessa blog veteran, you\u2019ll recall I used to run a series on the blog entitled just that, Life Lately. It was a weekly roundup of what I was eating, loving, and doing. It acted as a kind of a check-in on life with you guys. If we\u2019d sat down to have coffee and you\u2019d asked me what my life was like lately, the post captured what I would say. But it also touched on what was rattling around in my heart and my head. What I was striving to do better, overcome, accept, and so on. In short, how I was working to live a more authentic life. When my podcast partner, Brooke, and I were mapping out what our show would be about, and trying to wrap our heads around a name for the brand, the title resurfaced. Life Lately: a podcast about life, and living true to you. It perfectly captured the sentiment we were striving for \u2013 equal parts raw, deep conversation, balanced with the funny, ridiculous exchanges you can only have with your closest friends. Though you aren\u2019t sitting side-by-side with us, our intention is to have you leave each episode feeling like you just caught up with your favorite friends: strong, valued and ready to take on the world. We\u2019ve got FIVE episodes ready and waiting for you to listen!

Not lost, not stolen. Nope. I threw it away. I managed to toss it into the trash (along with my takeout leftovers), and that trash was promptly taken out. Brilliant. Then, last week, in addition to dealing with piecing my life back together sans wallet, my heat and internet went out. It\u2019s been a trifecta of operational disasters as of late. I was casually telling a friend about this at a New Year\u2019s party and was so struck by her initial reaction: \u201cYou seem so calm about the whole. I would be an absolute wreck!\u201d I had to pause for a moment. She was right. I was really calm. I\u2019d been without my ID, credit cards, and access to cash for over a week. Sure I\u2019d had help from friends and family, but still, it\u2019s a royal pain in the ass to have something like this happen (especially over the holidays). Add in the heat and internet situations and I\u2019m surprised I didn\u2019t spend most of this period cursing the world or in a pile of tears. The Clara of early 2015 and any time prior to that likely would have. When I first sat down to write this post, I planned to have it mimic the format from last year. 10 simple but valuable lessons to carry into the New Year. But somehow, this whole experience is what feels most poignant to me. What comes through is a sense of peace. I feel more at peace with myself and my life in a way I never have before. And yet I\u2019ve experienced more change in the last few months than I have this entire year. What that peace really signifies is acceptance and resilience. Sure I still my bad days (like inadvertently throwing away my wallet), wrestle with anxiety issues, fear elements of the future, or struggle with how to process the past, but those moments don\u2019t rock me as much as they used to. I\u2019m getting much better at recognizing two main things: 1) That in the end, it\u2019s all going to be ok (resilience) and 2) I can only control so much of my life (acceptance). These are huge emotional milestones for me. HUGE. And the fact that I\u2019ve been able to reach these points gives me so much excitement for the year to come. It\u2019s bound to be filled with ups and downs, but I know I\u2019ll always land on my feet. And though it will be hard at times to perfect that landing, there\u2019s not a doubt in my mind that I can do it (each an every time). Here\u2019s to a beautiful year. xx Clara","date":"1451914758","title":"Life Lessons to Bring Into 2016","media":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Screen-Shot-2016-01-04-at-8.17.27-AM.png","num_loves":0,"num_saves":1,"num_comments":0,"post_tags":[],"failed_media":[],"thumb_size":"596x588","native_blog_id":null,"native_post_id":null,"native_post_author_user_id":null,"native_post_url_slug":null,"native_blog_type":null,"media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/01\/Screen-Shot-2016-01-04-at-8.17.27-AM.png","url":"https:\/\/cdn1.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRmNsYXJhcGVyc2lzLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAxNiUyRjAxJTJGU2NyZWVuLVNob3QtMjAxNi0wMS0wNC1hdC04LjE3LjI3LUFNLnBuZw==?checksum=21fcc1eba4fa978a2b2780990409e51214ec53b2\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Clara Persis","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4693369909\u0026blog=11388463\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=none","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/11388463\/4693369909","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/clara-persis-11388463\/life-lessons-to-bring-into-2016-4693369909","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/clara-persis-11388463\/life-lessons-to-bring-into-2016-4693369909","likes":1},"4678324141:11388463":{"post_id":"4678324141","blog_id":"11388463","link":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/2015\/12\/chai-spiced-brown-butter-oatmeal-cookies\/","content":"Merry merry, friends! Popping in for a quick hello and an OMGsogood cookie recipe. I made these over the weekend for a friend\u2019s holiday party and all people could keep saying was \u201cWHAT is in these cookies?!\u201d And then they proceeded to have seconds and thirds, which always makes my heart so happy. So if you\u2019re still in need of a knockout cookie for Santa, this is it. I\u2019m in the midst of wrapping up work and presents before I head upstate, but wanted to very excitedly remind you all that my podcast (yes, podcast!) will be launching early in the New Year. Check back here or follow me on Instagram  for all the details. I\u2019ll be back next week with my 10 life lessons to carry into 2016. Until then, I\u2019m wishing you all the merriest of holidays with TONS of good rest! And as always, thanks for being here. This space wouldn\u2019t be what it is without you! Much love, Clara  Chai-Spiced Brown Butter Oatmeal Cookies adapted from How Sweet Eats Makes 16-18 large cookies For the cookies: 2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats 1 cup all-purpose flour 1\/2 teaspoons baking soda 1 heaping teaspoon cinnamon 1 heaping teaspoon ginger 1 teaspoon cardamom 1\/2 teaspoon allspice 1\/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg 1\/2 teaspoon salt 1 1\/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter 1 1\/2 cups loosely packed brown sugar 1 egg + 1 egg yolk, at room temperature 2 teaspoons vanilla extract For the frosting: 1\/4 cup unsalted butter 1\/2 to 3\/4 cup powdered sugar 1\/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 1\/2 tablespoons milk pinch of salt Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet (or 2) with parchment paper. Heat a small saucepan over medium-low heat and add butter. Whisk constantly until melted, then continue to whisk as bubbles form, the butter begins to foam, and eventually brown bits appear in the bottom of the pan. This will take about 5-6 minutes total. As soon as the brown bits appear, remove from heat. I always stir for an additional 30 seconds or so. Let cool for 10 minutes. Place half of the oats in a food processor and pulse until the oats are chopped up, some flour-like, but some pieces remaining. In a bowl, combine all of the oats, flour, baking soda, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, allspice and salt. Whisk together. In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter and brown sugar until smooth. Whisk in the egg and egg yolk, then the vanilla, until smooth and combined. Take a large spoon and stir in the dry ingredients, mixing until a dough forms. Scoop out spoonfuls of dough (you want about 2 tablespoons) and place on the parchment paper 2 inches apart. I put 5-6 on a baking sheet as they\u2019ll spread. Bake for 12 minutes, or until golden on the edges and thin and chewy. Remove, let rest of baking sheet for 2 minutes, then move to a wire rack to cool. For the icing: Heat a small saucepan over medium-low heat and add butter. Whisk constantly until melted, then continue to whisk as bubbles form, the butter begins to foam, and eventually brown bits appear in the bottom of the pan. This will take about 5-6 minutes total. As soon as the brown bits appear, remove from heat. I always stir for an additional 30 seconds or so. Let cool for 10 minutes. In a large bowl combine brown butter, vanilla extract, powdered sugar, and salt. Whisk really well (for several minutes) until the mixture comes together, then add in 1 tablespoon of milk, continuing to mix. If it still doesn\u2019t appear glaze-like, add in milk 1\/2 tablespoon at a time and mix again. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cookies.

The intensely hectic weekdays are probably also playing a role, but most nights all I desire is to come home, curl up with a plate of comforting food and my television obsession of the moment. And as independent of a person I am, this time of year does make me yearn a bit more for another person to share that with. One of the biggest motivators for my move back to Brooklyn was regaining a sense of community. Whether it was knowing my local coffee shop barista or seeing the same faces at the farmer\u2019s market (even if I didn\u2019t actually know those people), I craved a greater sense of connection to the people around me. But community can come in so many different forms, and it doesn\u2019t just fall into our laps based on zipcode. So this past spring and summer, and the remaining weeks this fall when Manhattan was still my home, I took that piece of community into my own hands. I started going to Central Park. A lot. Despite being one of the biggest tourist attractions in New York, it became my connection to the neighborhood. It\u2019s where I felt most grounded in my surroundings. Kids playing, couples exercising, families walking their dog \u2013 yes, it\u2019s rife with tourists, but it\u2019s also filled with New Yorkers living their everyday lives. It\u2019s the ultimate communal backyard.  I\u2019d run in the mornings and take long walks on the weekends or in the evenings after work. I loved it. It was equal parts soothing and grounding. The fresh air and open space quieted my mind, and the people I was surrounded by made me feel connected to that larger community I deeply craved. While I was eager to move (especially when I\u2019d secured my new home), I really enjoyed those last few weeks in my old neighborhood and apartment. It made me so appreciative of that season of my life. We have a lot more control over our personal happiness than we (I feel), often allow ourselves to believe. But it does involve some work, and there certainly is no cure all. It\u2019s a constant ebb and flow. A matter of pushing this button, then that button, seeing what works, seeing what doesn\u2019t, and so forth. Spending time in the park was like pushing one of those buttons. It wasn\u2019t a cure all. It didn\u2019t make me want to move to Brooklyn any less, but it made me happier in that area of my life. The other night, as I was wrestling with these seasonal feelings of craving a companion, I immediately thought back to my time in the park. It was like the universe raising her hand saying \u201cSo you\u2019re a little lonely. So what. How\u2019re you gonna to buck up and deal this time?\u201d I\u2019ve learned to love those moments. It\u2019s a reminder for me to get out of my head and into my larger life, with a swift nudge to focus on serving others rather than myself weaved in. In my old neighborhood, I wasn\u2019t going to ever crave community any less, thus I came up with an interim solution. In the same vein, while my desire for companionship will vary, it\u2019s never going to go away completely. So what\u2019s my interim solution? Ironically, it connects to another key reason I moved to my new home. More space to entertain. But here\u2019s the thing, I haven\u2019t gotten my act together on that front (i.e. buying a dining table, getting new flatware, etc.). Relationship or not, my current living situation doesn\u2019t make it easy to share meals with anyone! And that, in the end, is the main priority. As I sit here and type this there are about 50 other tabs open, each with links to potential dining tables. My solo meals for the near future will be devoted to ordering the final elements to make dinner parties in my home a reality. Come January (that\u2019s the deadline I\u2019ve given myself), this apartment will be packed on the regular with guests! The first dish? These meatballs. They\u2019re that good. xx Clara Baked Turkey Meatballs with Crispy Pan Broccoli For the meatballs: 1 lb ground turkey breast 4 shallots, minced 4-5 cloves garlic, minced (2 tablespoons total) 1\/3 cup plain Italian breadcrumbs 3 tablespoons milk 1\/3 cup grated Parmesan 1\/2 cup fresh parsley, roughly chopped 1 egg, beaten 3\/4 tsp salt 1\/2 tsp ground pepper extra virgin olive oil Set a medium-sized sauce pan to medium heat. Coat with olive oil and add in the shallots. Cook for 8-10 minutes, stirring frequently and lowering the heat if the shallots start to brown. They should be soft and translucent. Add in the garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until soft and fragrant. Remove pan from heat and let cool. Mix breadcrumbs with milk in the bottom of bowl you\u2019re using to mix the meatballs. The mixture should be dry and crumbly. Add in the remaining ingredients, including the cooked shallots and garlic once cooled. Gently mix together all ingredients with your hands. Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Form meatball mixture into 16-18 balls. Place on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, rotate, then bake for an additional 8-10 minutes. Serve alongside the broccoli or on top of pasta with your favorite marinara sauce. For the broccoli: 2 medium to large heads of broccoli, florets removed (slice the large florets in half) 1 tsp garlic powder 1\/2 tsp salt freshly ground pepper olive oil Place a large frying pan over medium heat. Coat generously with olive oil. Place the broccoli in the pan and sprinkle with the garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine and then cook for 3-4 minutes without stirring, allowing the broccoli to char. Stir a bit and then let cook again for 3 or so minutes, allowing the other sides to brown. Add two tablespoons of water to the pan. Increase the heat to medium high and cover. Let cook for 2 additional minutes so the broccoli is cooked through. Remove from the heat and serve immediately.","date":"1450057643","title":"Life-Changing Turkey Meatballs","media":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Turkey-Meatballs-Clara-Persis-2-600x900.jpg","num_loves":0,"num_saves":4,"num_comments":0,"post_tags":[],"failed_media":[],"thumb_size":"600x900","native_blog_id":null,"native_post_id":null,"native_post_author_user_id":null,"native_post_url_slug":null,"native_blog_type":null,"media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/Turkey-Meatballs-Clara-Persis-2-600x900.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn2.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRmNsYXJhcGVyc2lzLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAxNSUyRjEyJTJGVHVya2V5LU1lYXRiYWxscy1DbGFyYS1QZXJzaXMtMi02MDB4OTAwLmpwZw==?checksum=5fa9e7053adc8487a1ae1a315ce08b681b7a40ce\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Clara Persis","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4664321918\u0026blog=11388463\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=none","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/11388463\/4664321918","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/clara-persis-11388463\/life-changing-turkey-meatballs-4664321918","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/clara-persis-11388463\/life-changing-turkey-meatballs-4664321918","likes":4},"4639068597:11388463":{"post_id":"4639068597","blog_id":"11388463","link":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/2015\/11\/on-turning-30-big-life-changes-im-launching-a-podcast\/","content":"FRIENDS.

How did this happen?!! All of time seems to move perpetually faster these days, but this season, in particular, took on epic speed. The good news, though? I think it\u2019s because this summer has been so wonderful. Flashback to this time last year, I was deep in a period of running from my own life, not wanting to face any of the realities of my day-to-day. It literally felt like the walls were caving in. The older I get, the more aware I become of those dark periods. It\u2019s empowering to see how much I grow from every emotional rough patch, but that awareness also makes me incredibly thankful for the times when life is a whole lot brighter. And if I had to choose one word to describe this summer it would be just that \u2013 bright. Maybe add dreamy in there, too. Slow weekends upstate. Sidewalk dinners. Leisurely mornings spent in bed with the windows cracked. Creamy iced coffees. BLTs on repeat. Ros\u00e9, ros\u00e9, ros\u00e9. New bikinis and caramel colored tan lines. A city filled with the best of friends. Guys, it\u2019s been good. So good. As much as the thought of pulling on a chunky sweater and cradling a hot latte in my hands get me excited, I\u2019m really not ready for this season to end. This summer has also represented a lot of coming into myself. As I cozy up to 30 this fall, it\u2019s a relief to see some of those internal anxieties and personal demons fade away. They\u2019re by no means completely abolished, and there are days where I feel like they\u2019ll never die down (I\u2019m looking at you body insecurities), but I\u2019m getting there. Slowly but surely. So here\u2019s to making the most of these last few weeks, which should definitely include this ice cream. One of my goals this summer was to finesse my homemade ice cream technique, and this batch pretty much nailed it. It\u2019s one of the best I\u2019ve ever made! I will say, it\u2019s incredibly rich. The recipe makes a pretty small amount, but you want to do small servings with this stuff. It\u2019s the perfect thing to serve affogato style \u2013 place a scoop in a cup, then pour a little hot espresso or coffee over it. A few cookies crumbled on top never hurt. Enjoy! xx Clara Ps: This recipe come from the cookbook Date Night In by Ashley from Not Without Salt. All of her recipes are absolutely stunning! Do yourself a favor and add this to your collection.   Dulce de Leche Ice Cream from the Not Without Salt Cookbook Makes roughly 4 servings 3 1\/2 cups whole milk (separated) 1 cup heavy cream 3\/4 cup granulated sugar 1\/4 tsp salt scant 1\/2 tsp baking soda 1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped (and 1 1\/2 tsp vanilla extract) pinch of cinnamon Combine 3 cups of milk with the sugar, salt, baking soda, vanilla, and cinnamon in a larger heavy-bottomed sauce pan or pot. Bring the mix to a boil and watch carefully (the baking soda will make the mixture bubble up). Lower the heat to medium low, and simmer, stirring occassionally until reduced to about 1 1\/2 cups of copper-caramel color (about 1 hour and 15 minutes). Be careful not to let the pan scorch. Add the remaining half cup of milk and cup of cream to the dulce de leche. Let chill completely in the fridge for several hours (or overnight).

Did you raise it? Because I raised both hands. Here\u2019s how my Sundays have gone down for the past few months: go to the farmer\u2019s market or Whole Foods and stock up on the vegetables and herbs that look best, pick up whatever protein I\u2019m craving \u2013 fish, shrimp, chicken, or sometimes just eggs, make sure I\u2019m stocked up on a grain like wheat berries or quinoa, and finally, ensure I have the proper ingredients for a zingy sauce. Then I come home and transform all those things into a ridiculously delicious grain bowl. And then I eat that bowl aaaallll week long. I kid you not, this has gone down for MONTHS. I can\u2019t stop. It\u2019s in part due to Sprouted Kitchen\u2019s latest cookbook, Bowl + Spoon. It\u2019s a thing of beauty. As someone who really doesn\u2019t need any more cookbooks, this one definitely deserves a spot on your bookshelf. This recipe is a little labor intensive, but it makes a ton of food, which will either make you a dinner party star or leftover queen (or king, of course!). Enjoy! xx Clara  Sweet \u0026 Spicy Caramelized Cod Grain Bowls Serves 4 Cook your grain: I used wheatberries, but quinoa or brown rice would also work very well for this dish. Prepare 1 cup of wheatberries (cook according to package directions) For the cod: 2 pounds fresh cod, cut into 4 portions (You can totally swap out the cod for chicken, shrimp, pork, tofu, or another fish) 3 tablespoons soy sauce 1 tablespoon brown sugar 3 tablespoons chili paste 1 1\/2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar 3 tablespoons toasted sesame oil 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger Whisk all the ingredients for the marinade together. Place in a shallow bowl or dish, or my personal favorite- a big ziploc bag. Drop the fish in, coat well, and marinate for at least 4 hours and up to 24. I do mine the day before and let it sit in the fridge overnight. Set a heavy bottomed frying pan to medium heat. Place a tablespoon of coconut oil (or vegetable oil) in the pan, and let preheat for 4-5 minutes (if you drop a little water in the pan it should sizzle). Once preheated, place the fish in the pan and cook for 4 minutes on first side. Flip and cook for 2-3 minutes on the second side depending on thickness. The fish should hold together but still be flakey. Remove fom pan and set aside. Sweet \u0026 Spicy Slaw One small head of cabbage (or half a large head), thinly sliced 2-3 carrots, shaved 1 cup fresh cilantro, roughly chopped (plus more for serving) 3 tablespoon sesame seeds (plus more for serving) 1 cup roughly chopped peppadews for serving (not mixed in) 1\/4 cup fish sauce 1\/4 cup rice wine vinegar 2 tablespoons sesame oil juice of 1 lime 1 tablespoon honey 1 serrano chile, finely minced 1 tablespoon grated ginger 2 cloves garlic, finely minced Whisk together all the ingredients for the sauce in the base of a large bowl. Place the cabbage and carrots in the bowl, and toss very well to coat. Let rest in fridge for at least 4 hours prior to serving. When ready to serve, toss in sesame seeds and cilantro. Reserve peppadews for serving. To serve: Take four shallow bowls and fill each with grain, then slaw, then top with fish. Garnish each with more cilantro and sesame seeds, and a generous mound of peppadews.

How blissful is this summer? I hope you\u2019re savoring every last bit! A couple weeks back I polled you guys on Instagram to see if you were interested in learning about my 30-day sugar detox. There was a resounding yes, so today I\u2019m sharing my reasons behind doing the detox, my approach, the results, and my plan moving forward. Before launching into this, I want to make clear I\u2019m by no means a health professional, nor did I follow any specific guide, book, or online program. I crafted an approach that would work for me, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m sharing. Whatever efforts you\u2019re making to improve your health, I hope it helps. Ok\u2026let\u2019s get to it. Overall, I\u2019m a very healthy eater. My regular diet consists of a lot of fruits and vegetables, healthy fats, complex grains, and lean protein. But then there\u2019s sugar. It\u2019s always been my weakness. I fully believe in indulging here and there, but in the late winter\/spring of this year, my sugar intake got a little out of control. Ok a lot out of control. I craved something sweet after every single meal (breakfast included), dessert in some form was at least a daily occurrence, and my body was feeling pretty crappy because of it. Read bloated and tired. My friend Regina and I (both self proclaimed sugar addicts) had discussed teaming up to tackle sugar numerous times, but the conversation always sort of fell by the wayside. Or some event or holiday came up. But at the end of May, we finally bit the bullet and committed to giving up the sweet stuff for June. Not eating sugar or \u201cno sugar\u201d can mean a lot of different things. It\u2019s different for everyone. I firmly believe when approaching this type of thing, you have to do what will work best for you. We went with a \u201cbuilding\u201d approach, meaning that each week we expanded the types of sugar\/ foods we were cutting. Here\u2019s how we did it: Week 1: No desserts or added sweeteners of any kind, even if they were \u201cnatural\u201d like honey or agave Week 2: Same as week one, with the addition of more closely looking at labels- that meant getting rid of things like ketchup, nut butters with added sugar, processed carbs, etc. Week 3: Continuation of week\u2019s one and two, with the addition of being stricter around carbs in general \u2013 much less bread, pasta, etc. Week 4: Continuation of week\u2019s one, two and three, with the addition of no alcohol (more like a lot less alcohol :)) Here\u2019s how I felt: Week one, oddly enough, was the easiest. My cravings were intense, but I was so motivated to fight through them that I didn\u2019t dare touch the sweet stuff. I was determined to rid my body of wanting a piece of candy after every single meal. Pretty instantly I had a lot more energy and mental clarity (I was able to cut my second cup of morning coffee in that first week). Overall my body felt a lot less bloated. By day six my favorite skinny jeans practically slipped on. Week two presented my first major road block. I had a bachelorette party that was heavily centered around food. I didn\u2019t want to be \u201cthat girl\u201d that said no to dessert, but I really didn\u2019t want to break the challenge. Having Regina really helped here. She was confident I could be super sly about the whole thing, and just politely decline when dessert got passed around. Thankfully I was able to do just that. The whole weekend was actually a great lesson in the importance of keeping the challenge to myself. I think more often than not, if you\u2019re attempting to make a positive change with your health, others can feel threatened by your efforts and put them down. It\u2019s not intentional, but it happens. People say stuff like \u201cJust have one bite!\u201d or \u201cYou don\u2019t need to give something up!\u201d. The list goes on. Again, it\u2019s not intentional, but in my experience it can really hamper your efforts. Not making a big deal of it was a huge help to me. Week three felt like such an accomplishment. I couldn\u2019t believe I hadn\u2019t had dessert in so long! Things like fruit, nut butters, and even beets, tasted so sweet. My muscles and skin felt more taught, and I was really in tune with my hunger. That last one was probably the biggest benefit I experienced from the challenge. By eliminating sugar, I became acutely aware of when my body was truly hungry or my \u201chunger\u201d was just my body craving sugar. My appetite definitely wasn\u2019t as big as I thought it was. That probably also had a lot to do with the fact that I was eating more protein. You\u2019d think week four would have been the easiest (we were in the home stretch!), but it ended up being the hardest. Why? My period hit. The time of the month where I always went on a sugar bender. My cravings were through the roof. One evening they were so bad I just had to go to bed. I watched Fed Up, the documentary that basically outlines sugar as the devil, to keep myself motivated. I highly recommend watching that movie if you ever want some convincing to kick the sweet stuff. The interesting discovery was that my skin, which normally breaks out during my period, was totally fine. I always blamed the breakouts on my hormones, but it was clearly the sugar. It was definitely a rough week, but I made it through. In the weeks leading up to the end, I fantasized about what my celebratory dessert would be (there was a lot of Instagram stalking of artisanal ice cream shops). As it got closer though, I started getting nervous. I\u2019d gone vegan for a month a few years back and my first time eating meat after a month of mostly vegetables and beans made me feel pretty sick. Knowing sugar would probably be the same, I thought it best not to lose my shit on an entire cake. Instead I opted for a ice cream \u2013 just a single scoop. I was out with good friends, it was a quintissential summer night, it was the perfect time for an ice cream cone. Going down, it felt fine, and yes, tasted glorious. Then about 30 minutes later, an intense headache began to form at the base of my neck. By the time I got home I felt awful. I immediately took two Advil and crawled into bed. It took a good 24 hours for my system to feel like it was back to normal. My fears of falling back into cravings dissipated almost instantly due to how terrible I felt. My initial post-30 day plan was to indulge in something sugary once a week (generally applying that to special occasions). So far that\u2019s been pretty easy to stick with, given how much better I feel when I\u2019m not eating sugar as frequently. I\u2019ve learned my body doesn\u2019t react too badly if I have a homemade dessert here and there (like the blueberry galette I\u2019m holding above!), but any sort of processed sugar makes me feel miserably sick. So long gummy candy! One of the best decisions I made around this process was deciding to do it with someone else. Being accountable to Regina made such a difference. We celebrated each other\u2019s successes, and leaned on each other when we thought we were going to cave. All those \u201cwell I could just have a little\u2026\u201d moments were much easier to avoid knowing someone else\u2019s skin was in the game. Even though the focus was on sugar, the whole experience put me much more in tune with my body \u2013 what it\u2019s actually craving, when I\u2019m truly hungry, and how I can fuel it best. That, overall, was the biggest benefit, and has helped shift my finnicky relationship with food (which is a story for a whole other post). I\u2019m so glad I finally committed to doing this. I hope that was helpful for you guys! I\u2019d love to know, have any of you ever done anything like this before?

I\u2019d texted her from France that I had a bottle of ros\u00e9 with her name on it, so Thursday I went over toting wine and a slew of other goodies to make dinner. A big salad, a hunk of cheese, a delicate pile of proscuitto. It doesn\u2019t get much better. OH WAIT, except it does, because I\u2019d also brought the final bit of a batch of ramp pesto I\u2019d made the weekend prior. Oh MY god. Of all that is good on this earth. There are no words for ramp pesto.  Anyway\u2026.post summery feast, glasses in hand, we moved into her bedroom. It was time for a good ol\u2019 wardrobe review. Keep? Toss? It didn\u2019t matter the outcome, it just felt so wonderful to be sprawled on a dear friend\u2019s bed, engaging in deep conversation around the longevity of loud silk prints and whether she\u2019d really (like really) ever wear that dress again. AB and I only met through work a few years ago and yet she\u2019s become like a sister to me. Case and point: the closet review. You don\u2019t invite just anyone to do that with you. And she really sealed the deal when she sent me home with a bunch of luxe goodies. Definitely sisterly territory.  AB is one of five incredible women I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to cross paths with post-college. Most began with a, \u201cWe should get dinner or drinks\u2026you know, outside of work!\u201d Get togethers separate from work set the stage for long, raw, often wine-fueled conversations. Those get togethers grew to heartfelt check in texts sent on the regular, and emails filled with things like \u201cYou need to read this!\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s go here!\u201d or \u201cWe NEED to buy this\u201d and then some. I love these girls with all of my heart. They are my New York family. In a city that can feel so incredibly lonely at times, despite the number of people, it helps to know I\u2019ve got these little anchors planted up and down Manhattan, all over Brooklyn, and even into Queens. Loneliness can hit me like a freight train. Actually, it seems to only hit like a freight train these days. I\u2019ll be blissfully enjoying a Saturday morning at home, the remote all to myself, and then wham. My heart sinks, the fear of not finding a partner creeps in, and my head is swimming. The best way to pull myself out of this hole (in addition to picking myself up and getting moving), is texting one of these gals. Seconds later my phone will ping and that sinking heart is all warmed up again. So about this coffee creamer. The original recipe was sent to me by one of these dear friends. She\u2019s not a New York based anchor \u2013 we\u2019ve got several states in between us. But she\u2019s one of the best heart warmers I\u2019ve got. I don\u2019t keep paleo by any means, but this creamer is an absolute dream. Candidly I like to fill my coffee with a bit of milk and then top it with this cream, but you could do the same with any nut milk.

I\u2019ve always been a morning person, but ever since coming back from France, I\u2019ve intentionally worked to keep an even earlier schedule. It\u2019s also the arrival of spring and summer. Those breezy mornings where it\u2019s already light by 5:30 am? Just glorious. It makes it so much easier to ease into the day.  I\u2019ve been getting up around 6\/6:30, usually tinkering in the kitchen a bit (aka washing dishes) while I sleepily prep my coffee. Then it\u2019s a quiet hour all to myself \u2013 to cook, read, journal, blog, or simply do\u2026whatever. I\u2019ve switched my workouts to the morning, too, squeezing in a quick HIIT sesh at 8 am before scrambling to get ready for work. It feels so luxurious. There are moments where I really deeply miss having a partner. Or I\u2019m standing on the subway, staring gaga-eyed at a sweet baby, longing for one of my own. But it\u2019s in these quiet mornings that I have entirely to myself, that I realize this time is fleeting. It won\u2019t be this way forever, and while that\u2019s partially exhilirating, it also makes me value this period in my life so much more.  Now this ice cream. It\u2019s DIVINE. Buttermilk is seriously the key to life. I\u2019m dubbing this the summer of working on my ice cream game, finally nailing my ability to getting that perfectly smooth, creamy texture. If you want to do the same, this article from Bon App\u00e9tit on how to avoid common homemade ice cream mistakes is super helpful! And I\u2019m gonna guess I don\u2019t need to tell you this would make the perfect addition to your Memorial Day feast. Just add strawberries if you want that true whole red, white, and blue theme. xx Clara Vanilla Cookie Studded Blueberry Buttermilk Ice Cream Makes 1 quart 1 3\/4 cup heavy cream 1\/2 cup granulated sugar 1 1\/4 cup buttermilk 1 tsp vanilla 4 oz blueberry preserves (7 tablespoons or so) 1 1\/2- 2 cups roughly crumbled vanilla cookies (I used Tate\u2019s, but any vanilla wafer or sugar cookie would work) In a small saucepan, warm the cream over low heat with the sugar until the sugar is completely dissolved. Place the mixture in a bowl and refrigerate until chilled through, 6 to 8 hours. Stir the buttermilk and vanilla into the chilled sweetened cream. Freeze according to your manufacturer\u2019s ice cream maker instructions. I churned my ice cream for about 20 minutes.

One look at the soothing decor, incredible views, and OMG the pool (!) and I knew I had to stay there. Fortunately for me, the owners graciously rented me the two bedroom duplex for the same price as the one bedroom studio. It was an absolute dream waking up everyday to sunlight pouring in, enjoying my latte (thanks to the in unit Nespresso!) by the pool, and spending the evenings sipping ros\u00e9 and nibbling on cheese and bread on my personal patio.

Travel abroad was big on my list for 2015, and even though I\u2019d just gone to Paris last October, I decided it was worth making the trip again. Why? For two main reasons: one, if I had to make a list of people I wanted to travel to Paris with in this lifetime, Emily would be at the top. Two, because can you ever really go to Paris too much? The answer is no. Always no. I wanted to make the trip a longer one though, a solid nine or ten days, but I didn\u2019t want to spend all that time actually in Paris. Living in a big city makes me not want to vacation in a big city. I wanted countryside. Open spaces. A home that was larger than 350 square feet. Counterspace. The ability to DRIVE places. And quiet. I really, really wanted quiet. Thus I decided to spend the majority of my trip in another part of France; Provence. Another friend was initially going to join me, but had to cancel at the last minute. So two weeks prior to my departure date I settled into the fact that I\u2019d be flying solo for the first five days of my vacation. I was excited. Last Friday night I got on a plane. I arrived at Charles de Gaulle the next day to a train malfunction (no trains were running into the city). So I split a cab with another disgruntled American and made it to Gare de Lyon with enough time to spare to grab a baby quiche at a bakery nearby. At 3:30 I boarded my train to Avignon. Two and a half hours later I arrived in the French countryside, picked up my rental car, and began the one hour drive to the sweet spot I\u2019d rented in Provence. It\u2019s been nothing short of a straight up dream (dream!) since my arrival. I truly needed this vacation. I\u2019d been plagued with a feeling of homesickness for the last few weeks in New York. The reason as to why I was feeling that way has become much clearer since I\u2019ve left, but all that aside, I didn\u2019t expect to feel so at home here. I\u2019ve actually felt, in a way, like I\u2019ve come home through this trip. With a few days of quiet, clarity, journaling, and several glasses of ros\u00e9 under my belt, I\u2019ve come to understand why. Had I traveled with a friend, my focus would have been on our travel experience together. On my own, visiting a new part of France (and Europe in general), I\u2019m more aware of all the past time I\u2019ve spent here with family, friends, and loved ones. The year my family celebrated Christmas in the south of France. The house we rented in Switzerland when I was just nine years old (likely so memorable because it sat adjacent to a chocolate factory). Time spent along the southern coast of Spain with my ex. All some of the richest memories and happiest times of my life. Because my family, and I subsequently, have always leaned towards renting homes, cars, and so forth when traveling abroad, those memories feel so much clearer and closer, just by being here. It\u2019s as if I\u2019ve come home to them. I feel more at peace in my heart and head than I have in a while. But I suppose that feeling gets at the essence of a true vacation. I\u2019ll leave you with a few pics of my travel thus far. I have been eating like an absolute queen! More to come from Paris.

The other bonus? Veggies. I wasn\u2019t great this winter at working veggies into my eggs, but smoothies take so well to dark greens, making it easy to get vegetables in first thing in the morning.

My inability to lean into the discomfort of vulnerability limited the fullness of those important experiences that are wrought with uncertainty: Love, belonging, trust, joy, and creativity\u2026\u201d Bren\u00e9 Brown It started during middle school, roughly age 12. A stressful relationship with a step-parent was what fueled the beginning of some pretty severe control issues for me. To make up for the things I couldn\u2019t control, I focuses intensely on what I could \u2013 my appearance, my schoolwork, the organization of my room, at times the food I consumed, other\u2019s opinions of me\u2026the list goes on. Tack on puberty and general teenage angst, and you\u2019ve got a great recipe for the need to fixate on such things. There were some pros to my rigid patterns. I maintained straight As, did the whole extracurricular thing with flying colors, became a skilled piano player, and generally, from the outside looking in, appeared to \u201chave it all together.\u201d But the downside was that internally, I was riddled with anxiety. Over the years, that ball of anxiety grew bigger and bigger. The \u201chaving it all together\u201d shell was a double-edged sword. Deep down I loved (and let\u2019s be really real, still somewhat do) having people think I lead a relatively flawless life. Being able to control what they thought of me was not something I ever wanted to let go of. During those rare times I couldn\u2019t control what they thought of me (like getting in trouble for something at school that wasn\u2019t my fault or being teased by other students), I was an absolute wreck. Tears, self loathing, anxiety attacks \u2013 the works. As these patterns continued into my adult life, I paid the even bigger price of living somewhat inauthentically. I often bottled up my feelings and emotions in an effort to appease or not burden others. It was hardly a selfless act. I was completely driven by never wanting others to see my faults or imperfections, and to continue to receive praise for \u201chaving it all together.\u201d This made it extremely hard to be present. I spent, and still do, a lot of time in my head. Even though these patterns died down in intensity after high school, it wasn\u2019t really until the last 8-12 months that this exhausting act truly started to give way (or that I even realized the magnitude of the act). I\u2019d be knocked down in a way that I couldn\u2019t conceal. The energy I had previous fueled into seeking other\u2019s approval and praise was completely taken oven by simply trying to move forward. Through a series of very raw and real events \u2013 sobbing uncontrollably to a friend when I didn\u2019t know where I was going to live last year, avoiding new relationships for fear of the person discovering my imperfections and faults, or simply really having to ask for major help from numerous people for the first time ever \u2013 I was almost forced into being vulnerable. I had to really be myself, and the \u201cme\u201d at the time was a mess, lost, struggling, and hurt. The real me, by no means, had it all together. This was one of the main reasons why I really slowed down on blogging. My life wasn\u2019t shiny and pretty, and I didn\u2019t have the energy to make it seem that way. So for a period it felt like the only solution was to share nothing at all. Even though I knew the best blogs struck a balance between the real and staged moments, I didn\u2019t know what that balance was for me. Candidly, I\u2019m still figuring it out. I\u2019m fascinated by people who seem so naturally vulnerable, or who at least don\u2019t have to make such a concerted effort. I\u2019m making strides, but it is a serious, serious struggle for me. I still tend to run in the opposite direction of newness, uncertainty, and discomfort. I hate when things are messy. My automatic response is still very much a desire to fix and change and control and make perfect. I have to remind myself daily that life is messy, and that just because something is uncertain, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not worth exploring. In fact, it\u2019s just the opposite. Letting go and really exploring that thing, person, or path, could turn out to be the best thing ever. But I won\u2019t know or experience the positive or the negative if I try to skirt this whole vulnerability thing. Thankfully, seeing the good of staying open, especially in the last few weeks, has really opened my eyes.The having it all together shell is slowly being shed, but simultaneously, a huge weight has been lifted. And with that a whole lot more joy and growth. Touch\u00e9, Bren\u00e9.    Homemade Garlic Knots One small ball pizza dough (I used one ball of dough from this recipe, which makes two. Store bought would also work.) 1 1\/2 tablespoons butter melted butter 1 tablespoon olive oil 1\/4 tsp salt pinch of red pepper flake 1\/4 tsp garlic powder 2 large cloves garlic, grated 1\/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese (plus more for extra sprinkling) Preheat oven to 400\u00b0. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. Cut the ball of dough into 8-10 pieces. Take each piece and roll it into a 5 inch rope. Tie the ropes to form the knots. Place the knots on the baking sheet in two rows. Whisk together the melted butter, olive oil, salt, red pepper flake, garlic powder, and grate garlic. Spoon the butter mixture over the knots. Sprinkle with parmesan cheese. Bake for 9-11 minutes until golden brown and cooked through. Top with additional parmesan cheese and fresh parsley if desired. Serve immediately.

Happy Spring! I come bearing salad! A really, really good salad. The concept for this salad was born out of the coziest of cozy gal pal nights with my friend Allison this past Saturday. Ros\u00e9, truffle mushroom pizza, and a salad that reinvigorated my love for kale in salad form were involved. I woke up on Sunday and immediately started scheming as to how I could recreate the flavors at home. A few hours later and several bites of taste testing, and voila. Recipe below. Now. Because it\u2019s been a while and it\u2019s Monday, I\u2019m jumping back into the swing of things with a few all over the place life updates, random facts, and things currently on my mind: Friday. Night. Lights. OMG. I\u2019m currently 35 episodes deep (which is somewhere in the middle of season two). I realize I\u2019m literally the last person on earth to get into this show, but boy does it feel good. It\u2019s like a warm hug to come home to every night. I thought it would take me forever to get through all 76 episodes buuuut I\u2019m not going to tell you the amount of time it took me to go from 76 to 35. I recently mastered my quinoa cooking technique, thanks to this brilliant tutorial from Food52. Like the rest of the world, I\u2019m totally grain bowl obsessed. I got an advance copy of Sprouted Kitchen\u2019s newest cookbook, Bowl + Spoon, through work and OMG is it filled with the best grain bowls ever. Gonna taste a few and share my favs in the next few weeks. TRAVEL. I\u2019ve got major travel on the brain. I have two overseas trip on the horizon and now I just need to pull the trigger and buy those darn fights. It always come back to the flight, amiright? Like once I buy the flight, I know the rest of the trip is good to go. Are you traveling anywhere fun this spring and summer? Guys. This is a bit of an SOS. I\u2019ve been a TOTAL delinquent reader as of late. I\u2019m never one to say I can\u2019t get into a book, but Iliterallycannotgetintoabook. Should I just read The Girl On The Train? Is that what everyone is reading? Send your best recs! Kayla Itsines. Do you guys know her? Do you follow Instagram? Admittedly, not really my style but dang can this girl sell herself. Oh and she\u2019s like 23. I got a copy of her program through a friend at work and am giving it a trial run today. The short overview? It\u2019s a total back to basics style of working out \u2013 lots of pushups, squats, circuit rounds, a nice balance between light cardio and high intensity, etc. Permitted I make it through, would you guys be interested in some sort of review? If you have not set foot in a Banana Republic recently, please do, because they are pretty much killing it. Well, Mara Hoffman, that is. I literally want everything they have for spring and summer. Aaaaand just to throw a little SELF love your way, this article on how the hell you cook an artichoke is so helpful. It\u2019s artichoke season! Get excited and take advantage. Kale in cocktails. This will be my spring\/summer of kale juice in cocktails. I assure you, it does not taste like lawn in a glass. I had one on Friday night that was made with quinoa vodka. Oh, NYC. But it was so darn good. So if you\u2019re out and spot one on a menu, you best make it your drink selection. Now, your turn. Tell me what\u2019s up in your world! I\u2019d love to know. Here\u2019s to a wonderful week. xx Clara  Roasted Blueberry \u0026 Kale Salad Makes 4 side servings, or 2 main servings For the salad: 1 bunch curly kale, washed, ribs removed and torn into pieces (you should have about 8 cups) 1 4.4 oz clamshell of blueberrys (the small ones you see in the grocery store) 1\/2 cup shaved manchego cheese flaked sea salt (optional) olive oil For the spiced sunflower seeds: 3\/4 cup raw sunflower seeds 1 tablespoon sugar 1 teaspoon salt 1\/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper For the salad dressing: 1\/4 cup exta virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon white wine vinegar 1 teaspooon dijon mustard 3\/4 teaspoon maple syrup 1\/4 teaspoon salt several grinds fresh black pepper Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0. Place the blueberries in a single layer on a small baking dish. Drizzle with a little olive and toss to coat. Roast for 8-10 minutes until blueberries have softened and slightly burst. While the blueberries are cooking, heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat and toast the sunflower seeds until just fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Add the salt, cayenne, and sugar, and toss them around until the sugar is hot enough to stick to the seeds, about 6-8 minutes. (Note: This happened to me quite fast, but the recipe said 6-8 minutes, so watch yours closely). Transfer to a piece of parchment paper and spread out to cool. Take the torn kale and give it a few rough chops so you have bit size pieces. Place the kale in a large bowl. Drizzle with a little olive oil. Toss together with your hands and then massage the oil into the kale so it soften slightly. Set aside. To make the salad dressing, whisk together all ingredients but the olive oil until well combined. Then, slowly stream in the olive oil while constantly whisking, so the dressing will emulsify. Pour dressing over salad and toss well to coat. Next add in about half of the cooked blueberries and toss well to coat. Then add in 2 tablespoons of the spiced sunflower seeds. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper if necessary. Portion salad on to plates. Top each plate with the Manchego cheese, remaining blueberries, and additional sunflower seeds. (Note: If you were serving this for a big group, you could simply toss it all together.) I love to top each salad with a little flaked sea salt and additional fresh pepper. Serve immediately. Because this is kale, the salad does last for another day or so in the fridge. For an added protein boost, it\u2019s great with seared salmon or grilled chicken. \u00a0","date":"1427731946","title":"Roasted Blueberry Kale Salad with Spiced Sunflower Seeds \u0026 Shaved Manchego","media":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/kale-2.jpg","num_loves":0,"num_saves":0,"num_comments":0,"post_tags":[],"failed_media":[],"thumb_size":"600x900","native_blog_id":null,"native_post_id":null,"native_post_author_user_id":null,"native_post_url_slug":null,"native_blog_type":null,"media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/kale-2.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn2.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRmNsYXJhcGVyc2lzLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAxNSUyRjAzJTJGa2FsZS0yLmpwZw==?checksum=9b3de39ad4ad0d1e2c320f53db45237dc601a41b\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Clara Persis","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4262340378\u0026blog=11388463\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=none","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/11388463\/4262340378","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/clara-persis-11388463\/roasted-blueberry-kale-salad-with-spiced-4262340378","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/clara-persis-11388463\/roasted-blueberry-kale-salad-with-spiced-4262340378","likes":0},"4196330138:11388463":{"post_id":"4196330138","blog_id":"11388463","link":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/2015\/02\/gooey-brown-butter-blondies\/","content":"Real talk for a moment? I struggled to hit publish on this post because\u2026 of the quality of the photos. They\u2019re not my best. Ever since moving into my new apartment (although I can hardly say new, as it was almost a year ago!), I\u2019ve struggled with the lighting situation. My old space had massive windows with an expansive space to shoot. Now I\u2019m dealing with an air shaft and very limited hours of actual sunlight. But I do have a Whoel Foods one block away, so no need to feel too sorry for me. It pains me to put forth work that isn\u2019t my best, but at times, we\u2019ve got to. It\u2019s natural to always be seeking that upward trajectory, but having our work plateau or even dip in quality is part of that process, too (got it, Clara?). So I\u2019m doubling down and using this challenge as an opportunity to up my slapped together food photography skills, invest in some new props, and continue to work on that patience thing. Yeah\u2026that thing. Life lessons aside, these blondies are insane. I had to bring them to work to get them out of my apartment. Definitely make them for a crowd! And better yet, serve them warm and topped with vanilla ice cream. No one will care about the photos then. xx Clara  Brown Butter Blondies from Bon App\u00e9tit Brown Butter Mixture:     \u00bd cup (1 stick) unsalted butter 1 large egg \u00be cup (packed) light brown sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract \u00bd teaspoon kosher salt \u2153 cup all-purpose flour Blondie:  1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature, plus more 2\u00bc cups all-purpose flour, plus more 1\u00bd cups pecans, coarsely chopped 1\u00bd teaspoons baking powder 1\u00bd teaspoons kosher salt 1\u00be cups (packed) light brown sugar 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract Vanilla ice cream (for serving) Cook butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, stirring often, until butter foams, then browns, 5\u20138 minutes. Transfer brown butter to a medium bowl; let cool slightly. Add egg, brown sugar, vanilla, and salt and beat until mixture is light and falls back onto itself in a slowly dissolving ribbon, about 3 minutes. Fold in flour.  Preheat oven to 350\u00b0. Butter a 13\u00d79\u201d baking dish and dust with flour. Toast pecans on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until slightly darkened and fragrant, 8\u201310 minutes. Let cool. Whisk baking powder, salt, and 2\u00bc cups flour in a medium bowl. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat brown sugar and 1 cup butter in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating between additions; mix until pale and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Mix in vanilla. Reduce speed to low and mix in dry ingredients. Fold in half of pecans. Scrape two-thirds of batter into prepared baking dish; smooth top, pushing batter to edges. Alternating, dollop brown butter mixture and remaining batter on top. Smooth and sprinkle remaining pecans over. Bake until blondie is golden brown and firm (a tester will not come out clean), 30\u201335 minutes (Note: I would check around 27\/28 minutes). Let cool before slicing. Serve with ice cream. Blondies can be made 1 day ahead. Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.

I was home for the weekend (an environment that always triggers exploration in the kitchen), and I decided not only was I going to make pizza from scratch, I was going to grill it. Suffice it to say most of the dough ended up in between the coals, and my pizza more so resembled a cut-out of the state of Florida rather than a round pie. But despite its shape and the lightened load of toppings, it was still good. Really good.  I trudged onward, attempting homemade pizza back in my own kitchen in an oven. The dough got better but the pie was largely raw, due to the fact that I hadn\u2019t preheated my oven properly. Again though, it was still pretty good. Not perfection, but progress. I had a handful more experiences of this kind. I wrestled with dough, unsuccessfully transferred my pie to the oven countless times, produced pies that were burned on the top and raw on the bottom (and vice versa), and so forth. But there was something about the process that was still enjoyable. At the onset, I remember quietly thinking to myself that the pizza I made at home was probably not going to be good\u2026.for a while. But that the only way to get over the hump of it not being good was to practice. A lot. Instead of focusing on the failure, I focused on the small improvements that were made with each pie, recognizing there was simply no way around them. That doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t spend a good portion of those attempts cursing the dough recipe, yelling at whoever was nearby to help (apologies to those involved), and angrily throwing yet another pizza away in a fit of rage. That definitely all still happened. But somehow, I was driven to keep trying, to the point where homemade pizza now falls into the category of simple weeknight meals for me. The pies aren\u2019t always in the shape of a circle, but you guys, they are really freaking good. #patsselfonback  This realization around my pizza making journey was triggered a few weeks back when my therapist challenged me to think about failure. She specifically wanted me to think about the areas of my life where I easily accept failure as part of the learning process, and others where I leave zero room for it. Pizza dough, and cooking in general, is one of the areas I leave room, as is yoga. And not only do I leave room, but I still really enjoy the process of honing my skills in these areas \u2013 even when I\u2019ve failed countless times.  Yoga presents an interesting comparison as well. I got back into my practice this September. Having danced a lot growing up, I\u2019m naturally pretty flexible, but I\u2019ve always struggled with any strength based balancing poses. So I decided I\u2019d just start with crow pose as a goal, figuring of all the balancing poses, that was the easiest one. During each class when my instructor would encourage everyone to attempt handstands, headstands, etc. I\u2019d focus solely on getting into crow pose. And then a few months in, while in a completely different sequence, my body somehow found its way into flying pigeon. Albeit, not as good as that photo, but still. I was in shock. And yet somehow, it felt so natural. It was like everything suddenly clicked. The very nature of consistent practice allowed the progress to happen organically. Rather than being forced, my body found its way into the position on its own.  From a physical perspective, the same thing happened with homemade pizza. The reason it\u2019s now easier is because my hands are more familiar with the process, regardless of whether I\u2019m getting the dough to rise, kneading it, morphing it into a pie-esuqe shape, adding just the right amount of toppings, and so forth. I was reminded of how everything had already clicked when I succeeded in making this pie last weekend. It\u2019s been over a year since I\u2019ve made pizza from scratch (more on that later), and yet it was like riding a bike. My hands knew exactly what to do. The meal was divine. But then back to failure. No, I\u2019m not ready to throw my hands up and readily welcome failure in all forms. But I am more inclined to trust in the process, and accept that failure is an inevitable part of that process. And for those areas where I\u2019ve left zero room for it, I\u2019ve also realized I\u2019ve left zero room for growth. Ironic how that plays out. xx Clara Click through for the recipe\u2026 Classic Margherita Pizza I\u2019ve worked with a variety of different dough recipes over the years. For this recipe I tried out Ashley Rodriguez\u2019s version from her amazing new cookbook, but I did it using a standmixer. If you don\u2019t have a standmixer, I recommend Smitten Kitchen\u2019s Really Simple Homemade Pizza dough. I\u2019ve also used Ina Garten\u2019s recipe, and found that to produce an easy to work with dough when done with a standmixer. Here is Ashley\u2019s Recipe (Note: I encourage to double or triple the recipe, and then freeze the balls into individual pies): Olive Oil Pizza Dough (makes 2 12 inch pizzas) 1 tsp active dry yeast 1\/2 tsp granulated sugar 2 tablespoons olive oil 3\/4 cup lukewarm water 2 1\/4 cups all purpose flour 1 1\/2 tsp kosher salt Start this dough the day before or 2 days before you plan to use it. In the bowl of a standmixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the yeast, sugar, olive oil, and water. Dump in the flour and salt. Start by mixing the dough on low until everything is combined. Increase the speed of the mixer to medium low and knead for 5 minutes. Alternatively, you can knead the dough for 7-10 minutes by hand, on a lightly floured surface. The dough should pull away from the sides of the bowl and be smooth and elastic. Transfer to a container with a lid and refrigerate for 24-48 hours. Make sure the container allows room for the dough to double in size. After this first slow rise, dough balls can be frozen until ready to use. Defrost in refrigerator for 6 to 8 hours. Everyday Tomato Sauce This sauce was born out of one of those \u201cuse what I had on hand\u201d kitchen moments. I was forced to make tomato sauce with limited ingredients, and ended up with one of the best sauces I\u2019d ever tasted. This makes a big batch (far more than you need for several pies), so freeze what you don\u2019t use and throw the rest over pasta, chicken, roasted eggplant\u2026 the list goes on. 1 28 oz can diced tomatos 1 14 oz can diced tomatoes 1 small\/medium onion diced 3 generous tablespoons minced garlic (fresh!) 1 1\/2 tsp dried oregano 1 tsp salt 1\/2 tsp red pepper flakes extra virgin olive oil Generously coat a heavy bottomed pot with olive. Set to medium heat. Add in onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and transluscent, about 10-12 minutes. Add in garlic and oregano, and cook for another minute or so until garlic is soft and fragrant. Add in tomatoes, salt, and red pepper flakes. Stir to combine and simmer for 25-30 minutes until sauce has thickened. Once cooked, remove from heat, and blend using an immersion blender. You want the sauce to be slightly chunky, not super smooth, so don\u2019t blend completely. Alternatively, you can transfer half of the sauce to a blender, blend, and then transfer back to the pot. Taste an adjust for seasonings (additional salt may be necessary). Classic Margherita Pizza  1\/3 cup everyday tomato sauce 1\/2 of a medium ball fresh mozzarella, sliced 1\/4 grated pecorino cheese Fresh basil leaves Additional olive oil, grated cheese, red pepper flakes \u2013 and whatever other toppings you like Position an oven rack on the very top rung of your oven. If you\u2019re using a pizza stone, now\u2019s the time to put it in the oven. Preheat your oven to 450\u2022 roughly one hour before you plan to bake it. At the same time, remove the dough from the fridge and place it on a well floured countertop. After an hour, press out or roll out your dough to a 10 inch round. Place the dough on the back of a flour-dusted baking sheet (or pizza peel if you have it). Brush with olive and top with tomato sauce, spreading evenly. Distribute mozzarella across the pie, then top with the gated pecorino. Finish with another drizzle of olive oil. (The key here is to not weigh down your pizza too much. While I\u2019ve noted measurements above, do your best to adjust to the size of your pie. Over time you should go by feel rather than exact measurements.) Because I find it challenging to transfer my pie from a pizza peel or the back of a flour\u2019ed baking sheet, I do the following: Once the oven is preheated, place your prepped pie on the baking sheet into the oven. Bake for 8 minutes, rotating halfway through. After 8 minutes, the pie should be sturdy enough to slide directly onto your oven rack. Slide onto the rack, andb ake for an additional 4-5 minutes so the bottom cooks. Then, turn your broiler on and broil for 3-5 minutes, until cheese is golden brown and crust is deeply bronzed on the edges. Once cooked, let pizza rest for 5 or so minuten to let cheese set. Top with fresh basil and serve immediately.","date":"1421679041","title":"On Homemade Pizza, Yoga, and Failure","media":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_6017.jpg","num_loves":7,"num_saves":1,"num_comments":0,"post_tags":[],"failed_media":[],"thumb_size":"576x841","native_blog_id":null,"native_post_id":null,"native_post_author_user_id":null,"native_post_url_slug":null,"native_blog_type":null,"media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/IMG_6017.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn2.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRmNsYXJhcGVyc2lzLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAxNSUyRjAxJTJGSU1HXzYwMTcuanBn?checksum=370b358d6878e8471c72aa1c32be27cac568df3d\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Clara Persis","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4105054493\u0026blog=11388463\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=none","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/11388463\/4105054493","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/clara-persis-11388463\/on-homemade-pizza-yoga-failure-4105054493","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/clara-persis-11388463\/on-homemade-pizza-yoga-failure-4105054493","likes":8},"4040796747:11388463":{"post_id":"4040796747","blog_id":"11388463","link":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/2015\/01\/10-life-lesson-from-2014\/","content":"If 2014 was the year of change, then 2015 will be the year of sifting through all that change and working to truly understand it. In the first few days of this New Year, I feel much more inclined to look back\u2013 not for fear of moving forward, though. Rather, in order to be sure I gather up all those bits of knowledge and insight, and pack them deep inside my brain. And probably my heart, too. On a flight back to the city last week week, I began to jot down the little bits. Bits turned to fuller thoughts, then actual ideas, and finally, lessons. After about an hour of scribbling, the following 10 stood out: 1. Perfectionism is a freaking plague. It holds us back in so many ways. I personally have to fight against it constantly in order to just be myself. My paralyzingly desire to have others think I\u2019ve always got it all together does far more detriment than good. Not to mention it\u2019s an outright lie. 2. People are not inherently malicious or mean spirited. Most of us are just trying to do the best that we can (or know how to). Go easy on others. Forgive relentlessly. 3. And on that note, forgiveness is freedom. 4. \u201cNothing haunts us like the things we don\u2019t say.\u201d This quote weighs so heavily on me. Say what you truly mean in the moment. You\u2019ll be much better off in the long run. 5. It\u2019s very important to spend a little time doing absolutely nothing every.single.week. 6. It benefits no one to feel guilty when asking for help. Ask for the help you need and accept it graciously. Then focus on ways you can help others. 7. Take the time. Take the time to really listen to others, to treat the people that deserve it most, to send that sweet text to an old friend, to tell people what a freaking good job their doing, to say thank you to your Mom a million bazillion times\u2026.the list goes on. 8. Accept the damn compliment. 9. Learn to go through, rather than around, the discomfort. It\u2019s the real work, but that\u2019s where the good stuff lies. 10. Self love might be he hardest thing. Ever. But we (I) must, must keep trying. I\u2019d consider it a huge feat if I could master even just two or three of these this year. But I\u2019m gonna shoot for all 10, because as I also learned numerous times over in 2014 \u2013 you\u2019ve gotta start somewhere.  xx Clara Image via College Vintage, Source TFS","date":"1420643748","title":"10 Life Lessons to Carry Into 2015","media":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/560fc18f219559d114a663d5003b5c8f-2-600x776.jpg","num_loves":4,"num_saves":0,"num_comments":0,"post_tags":[],"failed_media":[],"thumb_size":"600x776","native_blog_id":null,"native_post_id":null,"native_post_author_user_id":null,"native_post_url_slug":null,"native_blog_type":null,"media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/01\/560fc18f219559d114a663d5003b5c8f-2-600x776.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn1.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRmNsYXJhcGVyc2lzLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAxNSUyRjAxJTJGNTYwZmMxOGYyMTk1NTlkMTE0YTY2M2Q1MDAzYjVjOGYtMi02MDB4Nzc2LmpwZw==?checksum=37f82ed7cb223fd64e3c07002e15869d9b8652b2\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Clara Persis","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=4040796747\u0026blog=11388463\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=none","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/11388463\/4040796747","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/clara-persis-11388463\/10-life-lessons-to-carry-into-2015-4040796747","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/clara-persis-11388463\/10-life-lessons-to-carry-into-2015-4040796747","likes":4},"4015074023:11388463":{"post_id":"4015074023","blog_id":"11388463","link":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/2015\/01\/its-a-new-year\/","content":"When I put blogging on hold back in August, I thought the next step would be the \u201cgoodbye\u201d post. For weeks I felt this pressure to get some sort of explanation up as to why I wasn\u2019t blogging anymore. And despite not being much of a procrastinator, the weeks went on and I never wrote it. Then, around late September, it hit me. I shouldn\u2019t write the post. I couldn\u2019t. In the back of my mind I had this small inkling that some day I would return to this space. And beyond that inkling, I also had a feeling I\u2019d know exactly when that time had arrived. In late November things started to percolate.  2014 was just plain hard. My personal life was turned on its head. I moved out of an apartment and neighborhood I absolutely loved into an apartment and neighborhood I never thought I could love. Working alone and living alone really started to weigh on me. I felt a pull back towards the stability of a corporate job but a huge amount of shame and guilt around pursing that shift because of everything I\u2019d built. I thought people would think I\u2019d given up, that I\u2019d failed. And then on top of that, the pressure to continue producing beautiful content that conveyed this near perfect life (as lifestyle blogs tend to do) \u2013 it was all just too much. There was so much for me to process personally, there simply wasn\u2019t room for blogging. I\u2019d even go so far as to say that blogging was detrimental to that effort. I got tired of taking these unplanned breaks where I\u2019d disappear for a week or two, then scurry to pick things back up, full of promises that \u201cI\u2019d be back\u201d or \u201cthings would be better.\u201d None of that happened, and the whole pattern only resulted in poorly written posts which still attempted to wrap my life up in a perfect little bow (again, as lifestyle blogs tend to do), when really my life was the farthest thing from a pretty package. So in July, when my \u201cexploration\u201d of transitioning back to a company became a reality, I had to stop. Mentally, I couldn\u2019t continue in both spaces. I began interviewing intensely for jobs and wrapping up my freelance work. July and August were the hardest months of this year. Reeling emotionally from all that had happened in the previous 6 months and dealing with so much uncertainty\u2026. I barely had the energy to do anything but work, sleep, and eat. I closed myself off from a lot and essentially went into a survival mode. As hard as it was, there were great outcomes to that period, the main one being my position at SELF. At the beginning of September, I stepped in as their Social Media Editor. There is much to be said about that shift \u2013 my decision to transition back into the corporate environment, the job application process, the specific reasons I selected the magazine, and so on. I will get to all of that, I promise! I\u2019m really excited to talk about it. But in an effort to keep this post from becoming a novel, I\u2019ll save that for another day. As bleak as this year was, there\u2019s been so much growth and progress. It\u2019s brought to light one of my favorite books, Elizabeth Lesser\u2019s memoir Broken Open. In it, Lesser shares stories of people, including herself, who have been through incredibly trying times \u2013 heartbreak, deep loss, disease, and so forth. But what\u2019s unique about these stories is that instead of the person being broken down and defeated by their hardship, they\u2019re broken open and transformed. It\u2019s a beautiful piece, and the learnings could not ring more true for the last 12 months of my life. I\u2019ve literally been ripped to shreds, and, candidly, continue to be on a daily basis. I\u2019ve been forced to truly face all those personal demons I\u2019d consistently told myself I\u2019d \u201csolved\u201d years ago. It\u2019s the hardest work I\u2019ve ever done, but I\u2019m so thankful it\u2019s happening. So. Where does that leave us? Well, food is still my heart. It\u2019s the thing that heals and calms me. It\u2019s where this blog began 4 years ago and where I\u2019d like to return first. I simply can\u2019t create the volume of posts I was doing before, so for now it will be once per week (fingers crossed!). Maybe that will change in the future, maybe it won\u2019t. I\u2019m working on reveling in the uncertainty of it all. Huge thanks if you\u2019ve made it this far, and even more so if you\u2019ve hung with me these past few months. Aren\u2019t you excited for 2015? I so am.

Eight years my senior, her general life advice and \u201cwhat matters and doesn\u2019t matter\u201d meter is spot on (read: way stronger than mine). So when she asked if I wanted to do the Whole30 program with her in September, it gave me pause. And then also have a mild panic attack because I\u2019d have to give up cookies. Twenty eight going on eight right here. In certain ways, a program like Whole30 aligns perfectly with the way I view food and diet. In other ways, it goes one hundred percent against my philosophies. A few years back I did a vegan diet for a month (that, naturally, was also inspired by Brooke). I did it mostly for health reasons, but also to prove I actually could do it. I was able to do it and I did feel healthier, but here was the unexpected result- it had a really eye opening impact on the way I cook, and the way I think about food. It makes sense. When you\u2019re limited by your ingredients and forced to find different methods, it naturally pushes you outside of your comfort zone. But the benefits of that time are still very strongly with me. I learned to prepare tofu really, really well (case in point). My appreciation for beans, just straight up beans, grew by leaps and bounds. I experimented with all kinds of tahini based dressings, discovered the magic that is pickled red onions, and then some. So in terms of pushing myself to explore new methods of cooking and cozying up to different ingredients, yes, Whole30 totally aligns with my food philosophies. But when it comes to the joy of dining out and sharing food with others, it goes deeply against. This program is strict ya\u2019ll. Another thing I remember about being a vegan? I barely ate out or with others. I was in a relationship, we did it together, and for the most part holed ourselves up for the month. Relationship or not, I really missed the social aspect of dining. Maybe that just means I should be less strict? But then does it really work??? I\u2019m torn. I\u2019m really curious\u2026 have you guys done it? Did you feel eons better? Did it change the way you cook for the good? Did you have to customize every meal you ordered at a restaurant? Not sure I can bring myself to do that last one.

Friday is far away. Let\u2019s talk about some good food, shall we? Instead of rounding up my five favorite things for the month of August, I\u2019ve rounded up five tantalizing recipes from my five favorite food bloggers as of late. In no particular order\u2026 1. Not Without Salt  I would literally fly to Seattle to have Ashley make me dinner. Not creepy at all. I envision her warmly opening the door, handing me a crisp glass of white, and bringing me into her kitchen that would be filled with the most amazing smells. There\u2019d be a really classy appetizer, like thinly sliced radishes and butter waiting on the table, and we\u2019d chat and gab until dinner was ready. Could we please eat these Plank Grilled Salmon sandwiches? 2. Love \u0026 Lemons Whenever I feel like the presence of vegetables in my life has been lacking and I need to jumpstart my inspiration, I head to Jeanine\u2019s site. Literally since viewing this peach salad with mint and pistachios, I cannot stop putting peaches and fresh herbs into every salad I make. I\u2019ve yet to make her mint pistachio combo, but doesn\u2019t it sound incredible? I think it would also be really good all chopped up and served on top of grilled fish or lamb. Mmmm dreamy. 3. Minimalist Baker Holy food porn. I\u2019m literally having DREAMS about Dana\u2019s No Bake Peanut Butter Cheesecakes. She describes them as sexy. I have to totally agree. They\u2019re also vegan, which for looking so decadent, is wildly impressive. Side note: I also really loved Dana\u2019s podcast with Jess Lively where she talks about her minimalist lifestyle beyond food. I sort of thought I was somewhat of a minimalist prior to hearing Dana speak. HA! So not the case! But it\u2019s still really interesting to learn more about it, and made me want to adopt some of her tips. 4. A House in the Hills Sarah\u2019s eating clean for the month of August. I am not. But I\u2019m still following along on her gorgeous journey and selectively garnering inspiration, while consuming things like ice cream and burgers. One dish on my must make list- this Overnight Buckwheat and Cashew Parfait, topped with BEE POLLEN. First I have to find bee pollen. Can anyone tell me where to buy that? 5. Honestly YUM The color of these blueberry muffins literally blows my mind. Aren\u2019t they stunning? Must must make these babies. The only thing they\u2019re missing (in my mind) is some sort of citrus. I love a little lemon zest in coffee cakes and muffins. I\u2019m also just generally into the Honestly YUM site. Their cocktails are so creative and they have a recipe for Bacon Granola. Yep, you read right. That\u2019s also on the must make list. Have a great week, friends! And if you\u2019re dragging a little this morning, I love this quote Grace posted last night. xx Clara","date":"1407760570","title":"Five Favorites: Food Bloggers","media":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/5-favorites-roundup-1.jpg","num_loves":3,"num_saves":0,"num_comments":0,"post_tags":[],"failed_media":[],"thumb_size":"600x921","native_blog_id":null,"native_post_id":null,"native_post_author_user_id":null,"native_post_url_slug":null,"native_blog_type":null,"media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/08\/5-favorites-roundup-1.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn1.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRmNsYXJhcGVyc2lzLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAxNCUyRjA4JTJGNS1mYXZvcml0ZXMtcm91bmR1cC0xLmpwZw==?checksum=a645d8145fdfceaf0f298658ec39a9664e7bac44\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Clara Persis","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=3252501077\u0026blog=11388463\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=none","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/11388463\/3252501077","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/clara-persis-11388463\/five-favorites-food-bloggers-3252501077","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/clara-persis-11388463\/five-favorites-food-bloggers-3252501077","likes":3},"3240530715:11388463":{"post_id":"3240530715","blog_id":"11388463","link":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/2014\/08\/friday-santa-fe\/","content":"Oh haaaayyy, Friday.

This visit was particularly wonderful due to all the recent rain they\u2019ve had; the landscape is so lush right now. There were points when driving on the highway where the mountains were covered in such rich greenery, it was hard to believe we were in the desert. And then the way in which the bright florals and vegetation wrapped around the darling adobe homes? Breathtaking. I can\u2019t stop staring at that photo above!

The bitter cold and miserable humidity, coupled with all the other not so nice things about New York (i.e. subway smells) can really push you to your limits. But this summer, oh man, is this city being kind to us weather-wise. The last few weeks of brisk mornings and breezy nights have made me fall so hard for this sweet city of mine and I could not be more thankful.  In honor of this glorious weather, here are a handful of my favorite activities\/ eats to indulge in this time of year if you find yourself in NYC! Rooftop drinks at the James Hotel Riding the East River Ferry (such a great way to view the city!) Numerous trips to Big Gay Ice Cream Ice Lattes from Oslo Coffee (best iced lattes EVER) and walks around Williamsburg Walks\/runs along the West Side Highway Shake Shack in Madison Square Park Chloe\u2019s Soft Serve when I\u2019ve been eating too much ice cream Happy hour in the backyard at Gottino (get the ricotta fig crostini\u2026 OMG) And my newest addictions\u2026 numerous glasses of ros\u00e9 at the bar at Claudette and dinner on the patio at Pig \u0026 Khao OH and this peach cake. It\u2019s an Ina must. I toted it all the way to the North Fork last weekend (along with these scones), and it was the perfect thing to enjoy first thing in the morning with coffee or topped with vanilla ice cream for dessert. Get into it!  Fresh Peach Cake slightly adapted from Ina Garten 1\/4 pound (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 1\/4 cups sugar, divided 2 extra-large eggs, at room temperature 1 cup Greek yogurt, at room temperature 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon baking powder 1\/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 3 large, ripe peaches, peeled, pitted, and sliced (4 medium sized) 1\/2 cup chopped pecans Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9-inch square or round baking pan. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and 1 cup of the sugar for 3 to 5 minutes on medium-high speed, until light and fluffy. With the mixer on low, add the eggs, one at a time, then the Greek yogurt and vanilla, and mix until the batter is smooth. In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. With the mixer on low, slowly add the dry ingredients to the batter and mix just until combined. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1\/4 cup sugar and the cinnamon.Spread half of the batter evenly in the pan. Top with half of the peaches, then sprinkle with two-thirds of the sugar mixture. Spread the remaining batter on top, arrange the remaining peaches on top, and sprinkle with the remaining sugar mixture and the pecans.Bake the cake for 45 to 55 minutes (I found mine needed the full 55), until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Serve warm or at room temperature. Keeps for up to 4 days on counter top, tightly covered.","date":"1406807238","title":"Fresh Peach Cake","media":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/peach-cake-1.jpg","num_loves":2,"num_saves":0,"num_comments":0,"post_tags":[],"failed_media":[],"thumb_size":"600x900","native_blog_id":null,"native_post_id":null,"native_post_author_user_id":null,"native_post_url_slug":null,"native_blog_type":null,"media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/peach-cake-1.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn1.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRmNsYXJhcGVyc2lzLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAxNCUyRjA3JTJGcGVhY2gtY2FrZS0xLmpwZw==?checksum=5eb5f2a13b8611d40dde24e9b0087ccf16d685f7\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Clara Persis","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=3206238553\u0026blog=11388463\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=none","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/11388463\/3206238553","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/clara-persis-11388463\/fresh-peach-cake-3206238553","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/clara-persis-11388463\/fresh-peach-cake-3206238553","likes":2},"3190687333:11388463":{"post_id":"3190687333","blog_id":"11388463","link":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/2014\/07\/weekend-scenes-north-fork\/","content":"Just a smattering of photos from a truly glorious weekend.

It\u2019s weekends like this that fill me with utter delight over the people I have in my life. Hope your weekend was just as special. Can you believe this Friday is the start of August?

In the dregs of March, when I can\u2019t bear to even look at another root vegetable, it\u2019s this dish I fantasize about. I\u2019ve essentially taken that same dish and subbed out the pasta for grilled bread. You might be thinking\u2026. \u201cThis looks great, Clara, but like, I totally want to add some mozz to that tomato party.\u201d I feel you. I get you. But please don\u2019t do that. And I say that as a mozzarella\/burrata fiend. There\u2019s just something about the tomatoes and the way their garlicky marinade soaks into the grilled bread that is, one, to die for, and two, needs to remain untouched. Trust me (and then you can thank me). And speaking of thank yous, thank you all SO much for your warm welcome back on Monday! It\u2019s definitely nice to be missed, and I\u2019m so glad to be back. Let\u2019s do this, Wednesday.  Grilled Baguette with Marinated Tomatoes 2 T minced garlic 4 medium or 3 large heirloom tomatoes (you should have large bunch of basil, roughly chopped 1\/2 cup olive oil 1 tsp salt 1\/2 tsp crushed red pepper flakes 1\/2 tsp freshly ground pepper one whole baguette, cut in half and the each half cut lengthwise Combine the tomatoes, olive oil, basil, salt, red pepper flakes, and ground pepper in a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate for at least 1 hour before serving. When ready to serve, brush the cut side of the bread generously with olive oil and place on a heated grill, cooking until golden brown and slightly charred (Note: My NYC digs does not allow access to a grill, so I just pan fried the bread cut side down in some olive oil). Cut the grilled bread into smaller pieces and arrange in a single layer on a large tray. Spoon the tomatoes over the bread and serve.","date":"1406113203","title":"Grilled Baguette with Marinated Tomatoes","media":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/IMG_5470.jpg","num_loves":7,"num_saves":1,"num_comments":0,"post_tags":[],"failed_media":[],"thumb_size":"600x764","native_blog_id":null,"native_post_id":null,"native_post_author_user_id":null,"native_post_url_slug":null,"native_blog_type":null,"media_type":"image","images":{"thumbnail":{"key":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/07\/IMG_5470.jpg","url":"https:\/\/cdn3.blovcdn.com\/bloglovin\/aHR0cCUzQSUyRiUyRmNsYXJhcGVyc2lzLmNvbSUyRndwLWNvbnRlbnQlMkZ1cGxvYWRzJTJGMjAxNCUyRjA3JTJGSU1HXzU0NzAuanBn?checksum=59fd5b325701e5d57d12a1ca9581219a54a4c52a\u0026format=h"}},"name":"Clara Persis","out_link":"\/link\/post?post=3165437965\u0026blog=11388463\u0026group=0\u0026frame=1\u0026frame_type=none","post_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blog\/post\/11388463\/3165437965","post_page_link":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/clara-persis-11388463\/grilled-baguette-with-marinated-tomatoes-3165437965","post_public_url":"https:\/\/www.bloglovin.com\/blogs\/clara-persis-11388463\/grilled-baguette-with-marinated-tomatoes-3165437965","likes":8},"3156785569:11388463":{"post_id":"3156785569","blog_id":"11388463","link":"http:\/\/clarapersis.com\/2014\/07\/savory-summer-corn-cheddar-scones\/","content":"Guys don\u2019t fret, that blogging sabbatical was totally planned. #saidnooneever To be completely frank, the whole turn of life events at the beginning of 2014 has made blogging straight up hard. I\u2019m in awe of bloggers like Grace and Jen who moved so gracefully through parallel personal transitions, barely missing a post. I reached a serious mental road block a few weeks back and had to put this space aside for a while. There were moments during that period where I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever pick it back up again. And through that, the lifecycle of a break up became blatantly clear to me. My whole notion that the farther you got from it, the easier it became, was pretty flawed. Luckily I\u2019m in a much brighter spot now, but I don\u2019t doubt it\u2019s going to take several more months for this whole experience to sort itself out. Recognition of the process, though, is really what got me to that brighter spot. Surrendering myself to the fact that life is simply not going to look at all like it did before is, in a way, a huge relief, and very liberating. So with that fact in mind (and on the wise advice of a dear friend), I decided to spend the past week focusing solely on the basics. Eating, sleeping, exercising, and working. That\u2019s it. Only those four. As someone who likes to take 24 hours and cram what couldn\u2019t get done in one week into one day, this was hard. But I was determined. I needed to get back to my life roots- homemade food, consistent workouts, placing a priority on sleep, and not staring at the screen past 10 pm. In a way it makes perfect sense that I found myself back in this space this week. Life felt kinda right again. It felt so darn good to pick up my camera and style some food again this weekend. And if I learned anything, it\u2019s that focusing on only the basics is exactly where I need to be right now. That and I should never give up my yoga practice, even if it means only practicing once a week. Seriously, someone yell at me if I do that again, ok? Oh and one more life lesson- scones are one of the loveliest things ever. Add summer corn and basil and they\u2019re even lovelier. When I pulled out my standmixer to make these yesterday, it was seriously like hugging an old friend! Yep, that\u2019s real life. Clearly Kitchenaid mixer activity needs to be part of my weekly basics, too. Bring on the baked goods\u2026 Thanks for hanging with me during this time. Have a great week! xx Clara    Savory Summer Corn \u0026 Cheddar Scones loosely adapted from Ina Garten Makes 8 large scones 1 1\/2 cups plus 1\/2 tablespoon all purpose flour (separated) 1\/2 cup corn meal 1 tablespoon baking powder 1\/2 tsp salt 1 1\/2 sticks (12 tablespoons) unsalted butter 2 eggs, lightly beaten 1\/4 cup buttermilk 1\/4 lb sharp cheddar, small dice 1\/2 cup fresh basil, roughly chopped corn cut from one ear Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Combine 2 cups of flour, the baking powder, and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add the butter and mix on low speed until the butter is in pea-sized pieces. Mix the eggs and buttermilk and quickly add them to the flour-and-butter mixture. Combine until just blended. Toss together the Cheddar, basil, corn, and 1\/2 tablespoon of flour and add them to the dough. Mix until they are almost incorporated.Dump the dough onto a well-floured surface and knead it for 1 minute, until the cheddar, corn and basil are well distributed. Roll the dough 3\/4-inch thick. Shape in to a disc, cutting first in half, then in quarters, and then in eights. Brush the tops with egg wash. Bake on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper for 20 to 25 minutes, until the outside is crusty and the inside is fully baked. Serve warm or at room temperature.
